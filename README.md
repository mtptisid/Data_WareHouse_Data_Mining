# Data Warehouse, Data Mining, and Machine Learning Project Setup

## 1. Introduction

This guide will help you set up a Python environment to work on a Data Warehouse and Data Mining project. By the end of this guide, you will have learned how to:
1. Install Python.
2. Set up a virtual environment.
3. Install libraries needed for data handling, machine learning, and database interactions.
4. Create and manage a simple SQLite database.
5. Perform basic data mining using **pandas** and **scikit-learn**.
6. Train a basic machine learning model for car price prediction.
7. Visualize data with **matplotlib**.

## 2. Installing Python

### Windows
1. Download Python from the official website: [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. During installation, ensure that **“Add Python to PATH”** is checked.
3. Verify the installation by opening the Command Prompt and running:
   ```bash
   python --version
   ```

### macOS
1. Install **Homebrew** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
2. Install Python using Homebrew:
   ```bash
   brew install python
   ```
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

### Linux
1. Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. To install the latest version:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3
   ```
2. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

## 3. Setting Up a Virtual Environment

1. Create a project folder:
   ```bash
   mkdir data_project
   cd data_project
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. To deactivate the virtual environment, simply run:
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```

## 4. Installing Necessary Libraries

Install the following libraries for data handling, machine learning, and SQLite database interactions:
```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib sqlite3
```

---
## 5. Installing Jupyter Notebook

Jupyter Notebook is a great tool for interactive data analysis. To install Jupyter, run the following command:
```bash
pip install jupyter
```

To start a Jupyter Notebook, use:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open Jupyter in your web browser, where you can create and run Python notebooks for your data analysis.
